Hello World!

This is my text editor C-Side! It was made using C with the help of the Raylib and Clay libraries. So far it has these features:

- Soft Wrapping
- Cursor Movement
- Save/Open New Notes
- Text Editing (duh!)
- Creating new notes
- Window resizing

...and many more details that you can learn about in the README!
